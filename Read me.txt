1. Install Jdk, Eclipse, microsoft net framework, microsoft visual c++
2. Install mysql installer commnity(using username = root, password=root) > install workbench
3. Create a schema name "premierleague" and a table named "login" having two attribute 'username' & 'password'
   insert the value of "login" table as username=test  and  password=test

4. Now, create eclipse project named "premierleague"
5. We create interface as New->Other->Swing Designer->JFrame

Database table:

For Cricket: fixture, mfixture(live score),teams,points table,semifinal,final,teaminfo,showteaminfo,coach

For Football:ffixture,fteams,fpoints table,fsemifinal,ffinal,fteaminfo,fshowteaminfo,fcoach


Interface
--------------

1. Coverpage
2. login
3. select (cricket or footabll)

3.1(cricket)
------------
1.Menubar
2.Fixture (Problem: Here we create table "teaminfo" on the basis of team names; if 'team names' contain space interface show error, 
           it causes problem in sql query. We have to solve the Problem)
3.ShowFixture
4. Datainput[live score is updated using mfixture table and sent match status to fixture table]	
5.Pointstable
6. Semifinal[we can implement live score system as 'Datainput interface' using 'semifinal' and 'msemifinal' table]
7. ShowSemifinal
8. Final[we can implement live score system as 'Datainput interface' using 'final' and 'mfinal' table]
9. ShowWinner
10. Teaminfo
11. Showteaminfo							


***We must go to the "points table" interface after an entry in "data input" interface ;otherwise points table in database is not updated.
This is because, we initialize "teams" and "points table" in "points table" interface


3.2 (football)
--------------
Almost same as Cricket
